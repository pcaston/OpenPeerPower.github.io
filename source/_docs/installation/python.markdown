If you're running a Linux-based platform, we strongly recommend you follow the instructions for a [virtual environment](/docs/installation/virtualenv/) instead.

Once Python is installed, execute the following code in a console:

{% highlight bash %}
pip3 install homeassistant
hass --open-ui
{% endhighlight %}

Running these commands will:

 - Install Open Peer Power
 - Launch Open Peer Power and serve the web interface on [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123)
