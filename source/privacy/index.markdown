Your privacy is critically important to us. At Open Peer Power, we have a few fundamental principles:

- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our applications, or protect our rights.
- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

Like most website operators, Open Peer Power collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Open Peer Power’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Open Peer Power’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Open Peer Power may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Open Peer Power also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the blog or forums. Open Peer Power only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Certain visitors to Open Peer Power’s websites choose to interact with Open Peer Power in ways that require Open Peer Power to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Open Peer Power gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who create a forum account to provide a username and an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Open Peer Power are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Open Peer Power collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Open Peer Power. Open Peer Power does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Open Peer Power may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Open Peer Power may monitor the most popular component documentation. Open Peer Power may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Open Peer Power does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

With your authorization, we may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your WordPress.com account through a social media service (like Facebook or Google) or if you connect your account to a social media service, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.

Open Peer Power discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Open Peer Power’s behalf or to provide services available at Open Peer Power’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Open Peer Power’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Open Peer Power will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Open Peer Power discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Open Peer Power believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Open Peer Power, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Open Peer Power website and have supplied your email address, Open Peer Power may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Open Peer Power and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Open Peer Power takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Open Peer Power uses cookies to help Open Peer Power identify and track visitors, their usage of Open Peer Power website, and their website access preferences. Open Peer Power visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Open Peer Power’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Open Peer Power’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

If Open Peer Power, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Open Peer Power goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Open Peer Power may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Open Peer Power and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Open Peer Power may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Open Peer Power’s sole discretion. Open Peer Power encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
