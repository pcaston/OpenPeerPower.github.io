Today we're releasing Open Peer Power Companion for Android 1.5.0. This is a great release with some cool new features and new collaborators joining in on the fun!

Big thanks in this release goes to our Android lead [@JBassett] who has been squashing a ton of bugs, added support for the status bar to adopt the application theme and fixed finding existing Open Peer Power instances on the network.

A cool new feature that has been added is a new home screen widget. Use it to quickly trigger your favorite scripts, scenes or any other service in Open Peer Power. Thanks to [@KBerstene] for the initial implementation and [@JBassett] for polishing the configuration screen.

For all you people that want to run the Open Peer Power app on a tablet on the wall, good news! Thanks to [@neopilou] there is now a new option to make the app full screen.

To get the most out of our apps for Android and iOS, check the [Open Peer Power Companion website](https://companion.openpeerpower.io/).

Enjoy the new release! Don't forget to leave a rating if you like the app, it will help other users find the app.
