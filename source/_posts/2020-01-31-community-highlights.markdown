Back in [2015][community-highlights-2015] and in [2016][community-highlights-2016], we tried starting a series of blog posts called "Community Highlight",
a few times, a blog post appeared about the amazingly awesome stuff our community does with Open Peer Power.

Recently, that idea was picked up again by adding an "In Other News" section to the release notes on each Open Peer Power release. However, the development pace of Open Peer Power is high! As a result, that section is always hidden all the way down somewhere in those release notes. A bit unfortunate, since there is so much cool stuff to be found!

So, today, we present you: the Community Highlights, the first edition!

Technically, not the first, but we rebooted this series, right?

We hope you enjoy this, please let us know in the comments below!  
Or join us for a little chat in our [#lounge at Discord][chat]

## A different take on designing your frontend

Mattias Persson showed an interesting alternative approach to the design of his Lovelace UI.
It looks fabulous; we don't even know where to start explaining, check the video below for an impression:

<div class='videoWrapper'>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/727tFhqpFAE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Mattias created [a post in the Community Forum][different-take] with all the details, including more screenshots, the things he used and links to his GitHub repository. Everything you'd need if you wanted to replicate this for your own use. Thanks Mattias!
