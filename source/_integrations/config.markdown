The `config` integration is designed to display panels in the frontend to configure and manage parts of Open Peer Power.

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

{% highlight yaml %}
# Example configuration.yaml entry
config:
{% endhighlight %}
