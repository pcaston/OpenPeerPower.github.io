Groups allow the user to combine multiple entities into one.

Check the **States** <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-states-icon.png' class='no-shadow' height='38' /> page from the **Developer Tools** and browse the **Current entities:** listing for all available entities.

{% highlight yaml %}
# Example configuration.yaml entry
group:
  kitchen:
    name: Kitchen
    entities:
      - switch.kitchen_pin_3
  climate:
    name: Climate
    entities:
      - sensor.bedroom_temp
      - sensor.porch_temp
  awesome_people:
    name: Awesome People
    entities:
      - device_tracker.dad_smith
      - device_tracker.mom_smith
{% endhighlight %}

## Group behavior

By default when any member of a group is `on` then the group will also be `on`. Similarly with a device tracker, when any member of the group is `home` then the group is `home`. If you set the `all` option to `true` though, this behavior is inverted and all members of the group have to be `on` for the group to turn on as well.
