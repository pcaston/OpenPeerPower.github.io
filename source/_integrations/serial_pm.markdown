Particulate matter sensors measure the amount of very small particles in the air. A short introduction how these sensors work can be found on [Open Power Management](https://www.open-homeautomation.com/2016/07/19/measuring-air-quality/).

Cheap LED based sensors usually use a GPIO interface that is hard to attach to computers. However, there are a lot of laser LED based sensors on the market that use a serial interface and can be [connected to your Open Peer Power system easily with an USB to serial converter](https://www.open-homeautomation.com/2016/07/20/connecting-an-particulate-matter-sensor-to-your-pc-or-mac/).

## Supported Sensors

At this time, the following sensors are supported:

* oneair,s3
* novafitness,sds021
* novafitness,sds011
* plantower,pms1003
* plantower,pms5003
* plantower,pms7003
* plantower,pms2003
* plantower,pms3003

## Configuration

To use your PM sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% highlight yaml %}
sensor:
  - platform: serial_pm
    serial_device: /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
    brand: oneair,s3
{% endhighlight %}

### Named Sensor Configuration Example

{% highlight yaml %}
sensor:
  - platform: serial_pm
    serial_device: /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
    name: Nova
    brand: novafitness,sds011
{% endhighlight %}
