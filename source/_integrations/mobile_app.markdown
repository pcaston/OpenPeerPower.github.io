The Mobile App integration allows Open Peer Power mobile apps to easily integrate with Open Peer Power.

If you are planning to use a mobile application that integrates with Open Peer Power, we recommend that you keep this integration enabled.

If you are a mobile app developer, see the [developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/app_integration_index.html) for instructions on how to build your app on top of the mobile app component.

## Configuration

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

{% highlight yaml %}
# Example configuration.yaml entry
