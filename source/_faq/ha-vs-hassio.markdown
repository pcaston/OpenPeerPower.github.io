Open Peer Power Core is a Python program, in simple words. It can be run on various operating systems and provide the ability to track, control and automate your devices.
When people talking about Open Peer Power Core they usually refer to a standalone [installation method](/docs/installation/).

[Open Peer Power](/hassio/) is a combination of Open Peer Power Core and tools which allows one to run it easily on a Raspberry Pi and other platforms without setting up an operating system first.
Open Peer Power is an all-in one-solution and has a management user interface that can be used from the Open Peer Power frontend. This interface is not present in a Open Peer Power Core setup.

Be aware that add-ons are only available in regular Open Peer Power installations.
